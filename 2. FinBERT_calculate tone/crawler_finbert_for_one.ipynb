Earth’s beauty changes in seasons. Earth is the sole blue gem in the universe. Filled with life as much as uncertainty, life is infinite and immense as well as vast and profound. Life is a blessing and a gift from above. The enormous life on Earth gave birth to mankind. Yet, it is the human race that sabotages nature, along with numerous lives! All lives have challenges. The human life is even a challenge in need of solution incessantly. The human life is given a limited time, which shall not be squandered in vain! The meaning of life is mainly to create more possibilities and future for the life yet to come. The life on Earth is the sum of all organisms, including all the flora, fauna, fungi, and microorgan- isms. The life on Earth is extremely diversified, estimated to be over 8.7 million taxa at minimum. The life on Earth is supported by solar energy. Plants requires the light from the Sun for photosyn- thesis, thus producing the food and oxygen necessary for the survival of all other organisms. Upon death of flora or fauna, fungi and microorganisms recycle all matters. All life is precious, for each and every life is unique and irreplaceable. All life has their values. However insignificant or trivial it may appear, each life has its purpose in nature. 032022 TCC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT TCC Commitments 1 Green Energy 2 Low-carbon Building Materials 3 Resource Recycling 4 Biodiversity: TNFD 5 Sustainable Governance 6 Society Inclusion 7 Employee Benefits 8 Key Indicators Appendix Every life is mutually connected with other lives. Like quantum entanglement, it is TCC has been committed to reducing the carbon emissions from our cement and concrete beyond a clear explanation. All life is the most precious gift bestowed divinely upon products these years. TCC is also engaging in the energy transition efforts in the world to Earth, which should be cherished and respected. increase the energy efficiency in use and decrease the carbon emissions from energy. Meanwhile, TCC endeavors to support the society in waste treatment and reduction. All life on Earth is interconnected. Species depend on one another For energy transition, TCC has also invested in a new energy company listed in France, for survival and a balance of the environment. NHOA (Noah) in Europe.

In addition, climate change can also bring about changes in the availability of water and With that, TCC seeks to direct public attention more onto the balance of nature other natural resources and possibly changes in disease spread. All these changes can have and the protection of the stable development of all life in the world. grave impacts to the human race and its ability to survive and thrive in the future. The human activities on Earth are causing drastic changes in the environment, leading to In parallel with the improving environmental awareness of humanity and circular habitat devastation and species extinction. It is not natural selection proposed by economy, there is still hope for life on Earth to create a nature, where they are protected and Darwin, nor survival of the fittest claimed by the economist Herbert Spencer. It is even no have a future. way near to the notion of the strong prey on the weak; nor is it selfishness or egoism. The opposite makes the truth about survival. In fact, mutual consideration, symbiosis, and Nature is borderless, the Sun voiceless, and the wind shadowless. altruism make the best path to true survival and development in nature. Creation is flowless, fragrance colorless, and life priceless. The world economy in the future must be a circular economy. A circular economy is a Benevolence is speechless, love demand-less, and cement formless. social model, in which wastes are minimized, and resources are recycled or reclaimed, to create new products or services. It is defined as “a system that uses resources in the most effective and sustainable fashion via systematic elimination of wastes with all materials Zuo Ren recycled or reused ultimately.” Circular economy aims to minimize the environmental impacts of products and wastes and improve economy through reducing costs in waste Nelson An-ping Chang collection and management and improve the natural ecology on Earth in the process.

In the scenario of the ideal warming mitigation or the highest warming level of temperature rise, the changes in the risks of heatwaves, floods, and droughts brought about by extreme weather are assessed. Note 1: The STEPS and APS in the World Energy Outlook 2022 of the International Energy Agency (IEA) are cited, which respectively represent the carbon price trend and emissions reduction pathway for the global average temperature rise by approximately 2.5°C by the end of the century with the current policy formulation scenario and the specific policies and carbon emissions managed with policies enforced by governments included as well as the global average temperature rise by about 1.7°C with all the climate commitments of governments, including the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term net zero goals, fulfilled as scheduled by the end of this century. Note 2: The references for the hypothetical prices are from World Energy Outlook 2022 and the carbon pricing options for Taiwan 2020 of the Environmental Protection Administration, Taiwan, without the preferential rate of carbon fee taken into consideration. Note 3: The SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios in the 2021 Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are cited. SSP1-2.6 represents a scenario of low greenhouse gas emissions. In this scenario, there will be a significant reduction in the global carbon dioxide emissions, the goal of net-zero emissions to be achieved after 2050, and a global temperature rise by 1.8°C by the end of this century. SSP5-8.5 is a scenario of very high greenhouse gas emissions with the assumption of high emissions and a significant increase in coal use in the future, rendering the impact pathway of a global temperature rise by 4.4°C by the end of this century. 752022 TCC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT TCC Commitments 1 Green Energy 2 Low-carbon Building Materials 3 Resource Recycling 4 Biodiversity: TNFD 5 Sustainable Governance 6 Society Inclusion 7 Employee Benefits 8 ESG Key Indicators Appendix Financial Impacts after Analysis and Assessment of Climate Scenarios Financial Impacts in the Climate Risk Scenarios of Carbon Price and Carbon Emissions Regulation For the cement industry with high carbon emissions, the impact of GHG emissions control regulations is evident. The most important cement production bases of TCC at this stage have been inventoried, which are located in Taiwan and Mainland China, respectively. In terms of carbon system planning in Taiwan, the Climate Change Response Act was passed in the third reading by the Legislative Yuan on January 10, 2023. The legal basis for the collection of carbon fees is introduced and is expected to come into force as early as 2024. The national carbon trading market in Mainland China has been formally established in 2021, and the cement industry has yet been included in the national carbon trading system. For the carbon emissions regulation of the cement industry in the region, a cap-and-trade system is in force via the regional carbon trading pilot. Through TCC’s assessment of the future changes in the yield of cementitious materials and the carbon emissions that meet the internal Financial Impacts in the Climate risk scenarios of extreme weather reduction targets, with the assumption of the enforcement of the carbon fee system in Taiwan and the inclusion of the cement industry in the national carbon trading system in Mainland China, combined with the three climate scenarios, i.e. STEPS, APS, and NZE2050, Through internal discussion, inventory, and assessment, TCC identifies potential risks in the production or transportation taken into account, the carbon prices analysis are as follows: phases arising from extreme changes in climate patterns like floods, droughts, and changes in precipitation patterns. A flood caused by heavy rainfall will lead to plant shutdown and equipment damage. In 2022, the Yingde plant had seen a once-in-a-century flood hazard. Back then, the facilities at the Beijiang port were submerged, resulting in a temporary IEA STEPS Reduced by approximately shipment failure.

Platform (TCCIP) and from the Chinese Academy of Sciences of Mainland China and with reference to the worst warming scenario of RCP8.5 in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), TCC has analyzed the operational and financial impacts on the Faced with the major transition risk of “carbon trading/carbon fee/carbon tax for total carbon emissions control,\" TCC has initiated the plants of TCC. In such scenario, the number of typhoons affecting Taiwan will decrease by 15% in the middle of the century, transition as early as 2017, planning for the increase in the alternative raw materials and fuels, production process enhancement, and but the proportion of strong typhoons will increase by 100%; the dry season in the southern China, the locations where the ongoing research and development of carbon capture technology , renewable energy installation, improvement to the efficiency of Yingde and Longshan Plants are, will increase by 54% in the middle of the century, extending from the average of 2.67 power generation by waste heat recovery, among other mixed resilience strategies, so as to reduce carbon emissions generated from the months at present to 4.11 months. The analysis results show rises in all the risks faced. cement process to increase the potential in operational reduction, effectively controlling the risks brought about by carbon pricing TCC shall continue to improve on the analysis of physical risk scenarios. In the future, the SSP1-2.6 ideal mitigation scenario policies. Meanwhile, carbon emission intensity is incorporated as the key performance indicator (KPI) for plants in order to improve the and SSP5-8.5 very high emission scenario in the latest IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) will be used to perform the reliability of internal carbon reduction targets. Moving forward, TCC shall not only continue to strengthen the carbon reduction efforts of assessment of changes in risks for operating sites. In addition, aside from assessment of the existing risk issues, the risk of the above-mentioned strategies, but also consider moderate production reduction and cement price transfer, so as to minimize the heatwaves is expected to be included as well, so as to strengthen TCC's climate adaptation management and strategies. The financial impacts of such risk on TCC. relevant analysis results will be presented in the 2022 TCFD Report of TCC. 762022 TCC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT TCC Commitments 1 Green Energy 2 Low-carbon Building Materials 3 Resource Recycling 4 Biodiversity: TNFD 5 Sustainable Governance 6 Society Inclusion 7 Employee Benefits 8 ESG Key Indicators Appendix Sustainable Supply Chain 5.5 / Target Setting MANAGEMENT APPROACH Join hands towards a sustainable supply chain TCC ensures consistency among suppliers in terms of quality, cost, delivery Five targets were set for the sustainable supplier management at TCC.

This helps children learn about Net Zero through carbon reduction, waste reduction, and resource recycling, while cultivating everyday carbon reduction habits such as energy-saving. The program instills in children the attitude of cherishing resources for environmental sustainability. On March 4, 2023, TCC and Heping Elementary School collaborated on the \"Hoping Carbon Reduction Parent-Child Bankbook\" program. Students and parents earn carbon coins for their carbon reduction actions, which can be exchanged for semester carbon labels or Carbon Reduction Label Award from TCC DAKA. TCC promoted the program to help students understand the connection between their behavior and sustainability, emphasizing the importance of individual actions for Earth's sustainability. The program also raised awareness of sustainability in the local community of Heping, creating a paradigm of carbon reduction action from individual behavior to community impact and ultimately to societal change.
